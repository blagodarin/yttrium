# Yttrium

Yttrium is (intended to become) a game development toolkit.

Yttrium features:
* **Friendly and flexible build system.**
  - To build Yttrium for the first time, you need Internet connection,
    [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/), recent
    [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and a supported C/C++ compiler, and you
    should already have all that if you build C++ projects from GitHub.
  - Yttrium can be built as a set of DLLs with user-provided dependencies, or it
    can yield static libraries that can be linked into a single binary &mdash;
    the choice is up to you.
  - Check out [build instructions](docs/building.md) for more details.
    [Contribution guidelines](docs/contributing.md) may also help you find your
    way around.

Yttrium is an occasional hobby project, so don't expect it to be something
actually valuable or to eventually turn into one. Right now it is more like a
bunch of various ideas piled together and roughly shaped to look game
engine-ish.

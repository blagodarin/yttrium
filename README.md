# Yttrium

Yttrium is (intended to become) a game development toolkit.

Yttrium is:
* **Easy to build.**
  - You'll need Internet connection, [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/),
    recent [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and a supported C/C++ compiler,
    and you should already have all that if you build C++ projects from GitHub.
  - Yttrium can provide itself with all third-party dependencies.
    The only exception is [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/)
    (which is required for the Vulkan backend).
  - Check out [build instructions](docs/building.md) for more details.
    [Contribution guidelines](docs/contributing.md) may also help you find your
    way around.

Yttrium is an occasional hobby project, so don't expect it to be something
actually valuable or to eventually turn into one. Right now it is more like a
bunch of various ideas piled together and roughly shaped to look game
engine-ish.

* [TODO list](docs/todo.md) with possible future improvements.

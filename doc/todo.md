# TODO
* Library:
	- Multiple windows.
	- Windowed mode.
	- Proper benchmarks (e. g. using some benchmarking library).
	- Debug output, e. g. in a ring buffer that can be dumped on exception.
	* Audio:
		- Windows Multimedia audio backend.
		- Runtime PCM audio generation.
	* GUI:
		- Line editor widget.
	* Image:
		- Compressed images (e. g. compressed textures).
		- Multi-level images (e. g. textures with mipmaps).
		- Separate image header/data loading.
		- Image packs (lists of image headers with filenames and raw image data offsets).
		- Loading image data into the specified buffer (e. g. into mapped texture memory).
	* Internationalization:
		- Unicode fonts.
	* Renderer:
		- Loading textures without intermediate Images.
		- Don't count debug output in rendering statistics.
	* Storage:
		- Hash-based packed file access.
* New tools:
	- Textured font builder.

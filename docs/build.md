# Build instructions

Building Yttrium requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) to get it and
[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) to build it. Yttrium also depends on some
third-party packages; if you don't have them installed on your system, you can
get them using *Yttrium third-party bootstrapper* (Y3) which also requires Git
and CMake (and an Internet connection).

You can also check CI configuration files ([.appveyor.yml](../.appveyor.yml)
and [.travis.yml](../.travis.yml)) for some hints on building Yttrium.
